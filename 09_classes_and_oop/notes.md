## OOP

- Object Oriented Programming
- a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects"
- objects can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods)
- OOP languages include Java, C++, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript
- This basically means that you can create objects that have properties and methods, and you can use these objects to model real-world things or concepts.
- OOP is a way to structure your code so that it is more organized and easier to understand.
